CS50: Introduction to Computer Science

This is the introductory course on computer science offered in Harvard university, provided online by edX. The main programming languages learnt are C, Python, and basics of SQLite. After completion of the main course, there are various tracks to choose from, and the one I had chosen was web development. I have not completely finished the course, and there is one final project left to complete. After which I plan to take up CS50's web development course, and also CS50's game development.
